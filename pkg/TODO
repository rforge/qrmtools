0) implement mean_excess_GPD() and use it in mean_excess_plot() in a similar way as tail_plot() utilizes GPD

1) improve run time of mean_excess() (see slow script ./R/05_Extreme_Value_Theory/05_Mean_excess_plots.R => sample size 50000)
2) implement QRM::showRM() and use in qrmtutorial.org scripts

### (A)RA
- Maybe write do.call(cbind()) and .rowSums(do.call(cbind())) as C functions
  to further speed-up rearrange()
- If one can fix rearrange() to work with Inf quantiles, maybe make rearrange()
  have already lists as inputs (replace sapply() by lapply() in RA() and ARA()
  to build the list of columns)
  => doesn't seem easy, see code

### Composite distributions (see Kurt's email, Sep. 25)
- Build objects:
  composite(distr, breaks, weights) sollte ein composite distribution function
  objekt x konstruieren und man kann dann pcomposite(q, x), qcomposite(p, x) und
  rcomposite(n, x) damit machen.
- Use 'breaks' as argument (passed on to cut())
