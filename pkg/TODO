- EVT: implement QRM::plotTail() (should work similarly to edf_plot()) and QRM::xiplot()
- Improve run time of mean_excess_plot() (see slow script ./R/05_Extreme_Value_Theory/05_Mean_excess_plots.R => sample size 50000)

### (A)RA
- Maybe write do.call(cbind()) and .rowSums(do.call(cbind())) as C functions
  to further speed-up rearrange()
- If one can fix rearrange() to work with Inf quantiles, maybe make rearrange()
  have already lists as inputs (replace sapply() by lapply() in RA() and ARA()
  to build the list of columns)
  => doesn't seem easy, see code

### Composite distributions (see Kurt's email, Sep. 25)
- Build objects:
  composite(distr, breaks, weights) sollte ein composite distribution function
  objekt x konstruieren und man kann dann pcomposite(q, x), qcomposite(p, x) und
  rcomposite(n, x) damit machen.
- Use 'breaks' as argument (passed on to cut())
